The 'Exploring NEON Eddy-Covariance Data Products in HDF5 file format' document provides a greater level of detail with pictorial examples, which can be retrieved from the NEON reference library as part of the additional documentation for the eddy-covariance download package.\r\n",

      "NEON = NEON. NEON denotes the organizational origin of the data product and identifies the product as operational; data collected as part of a special data collection exercise are designated by a separate, unique alphanumeric code created by the PI.\r\n",
      "DOM = DOMAIN, e.g. D10. DOM is a three-character alphanumeric code, referring to the domain of data acquisition (D01 - D20).\r\n",
      "*SITE = SITE, e.g. STER. SITE is four-character alphanumeric code, referring to the site of data acquisition; all sites are designated by a standardized four-character alphabetic code.\r\n",
      "*DPL = DATA PRODUCT LEVEL, e.g. DP1. DPL is a three-character alphanumeric code, referring to data product processing level. In the HDF5 files, this is represented as dp0L, e.g., dp01.\r\n",
      "*PRNUM = PRODUCT NUMBER. PRNUM is a five-character numeric code, referring to the data product number (see the Data Product Catalog at http://data.neonscience.org/data-product-catalog). We use abbreviated data product names instead of the PRNUM to increase readability of the file. \r\n",
      "    Example = co2Turb for turbulent CO2 concentration measured by LI-7200 IRGA (00034 CO2 concentration - turbulent); co2Stor for storage (or profile) CO2 concentration measured by LI-840 IRGA (00099 CO2 concentration - storage).\r\n",
      "*REV = REVISION, e.g. 001. REV is a three-digit designation, referring to the revision number of the data product. The REV value is incremented by 1 each time a major change is made in instrumentation, data collection protocol, or data processing such that data from the preceding revision is not directly comparable to the new.\r\n",

      "*HOR = HORIZONTAL INDEX.  HOR is the Spatial Index #1 and refers to measurement locations within one horizontal plane. For example, if five surface measurements were taken, one at each of the five soil array plots, the number in the HOR field would range from 001-005.\r\n",

      "*VER = VERTICAL INDEX. VER is the Spatial Index #2 and refers to measurement locations within one vertical plane. For example, if eight temperature measurements are collected, one at each tower vertical level, the number in the VER field would range from 010-080.\r\n",
      "    Examples: Ground level = 000, first tower level above the ground surface = 010, second tower level above the ground surface = 020. The soil sensor depth level closest to the ground surface = 501, second soil sensor depth level closest to the ground surface = 502. \r\n",

TMI is the Temporal Index; it is a three-digit designation and refers to the temporal representation, averaging period, or coverage of the data product (e.g., minute, hour, month, year, sub-hourly, day, lunar month, single instance, seasonal, annual, multi-annual). In a typical data product number, 000 = native resolution, 001 = native resolution or 1 minute, 002 = 2 minute, 005 = 5 minute, 015 = 15 minute, 030 = 30 minute, 060 = 60 minutes or 1 hour. In the HDF5 file, we represent TMI as 01m, 05m or 30m, etc. to increase the readability of the file. Examples: 01m = 1 minute, 30m = 30 minute.\r\n",
