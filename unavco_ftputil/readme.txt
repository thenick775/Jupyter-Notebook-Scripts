These files must be installed in the folder located above 'Downloads',
You must have the stations 'fileList' for the year in this same directory (the directory
below users)
Or add it to where your jupyter notebook directory opens to, as that is where
it should be.

Other than that everything should run as most of the libraries should be 
installed.
You may have to step through the notebook instead of using run all.

If any of the libraries at the top of the notebook are not installed, conda
should be able to install them
1. "conda search XXXXX"
2. if its there, "conda install XXXXX"

Notes: current sample list is for station qsec for 2018
       current extension is .18m, this represents the year (can be found in fileList or in the origional source files extension)
